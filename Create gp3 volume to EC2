# 📅 Day X/100 – Creating a gp3 EBS Volume in AWS

## 🚀 100 Days of AWS Cloud Journey

Today I learned how to **create and attach a gp3 (General Purpose SSD) EBS volume** in AWS and understood how storage, IOPS, and throughput work independently.

---

## 🔹 What is a gp3 Volume?

A **gp3 volume** is an **Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD** volume that provides:

* High performance
* Lower cost than gp2
* Independent configuration of **storage, IOPS, and throughput**

It is the **recommended default EBS volume type** for most workloads.

---

## 🔹 Why Use gp3?

✅ Predictable performance
✅ Lower cost (~20% cheaper than gp2)
✅ No need to over-provision storage
✅ Ideal for production workloads

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Create a gp3 EBS Volume

### 1️⃣ Open EC2 Dashboard

* Login to **AWS Management Console**
* Go to **EC2 → Elastic Block Store → Volumes**
* Click **Create volume**

---

### 2️⃣ Configure Volume Settings

| Setting           | Value                |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Volume type       | **gp3**              |
| Size              | Example: `20 GiB`    |
| IOPS              | Default `3000`       |
| Throughput        | Default `125 MB/s`   |
| Availability Zone | Same as EC2 instance |

📌 **Important:**
The volume **must be in the same Availability Zone** as the EC2 instance.

---

### 3️⃣ Add Tags (Best Practice)

* Key: `Name`
* Value: `gp3-demo-volume`

Tags help in:

* Cost tracking
* Resource management
* Production clarity

---

### 4️⃣ Create the Volume

* Click **Create volume**
* Status will change to **Available**

---

## 🔗 Step-by-Step: Attach gp3 Volume to EC2

### 5️⃣ Attach Volume

* Select the created gp3 volume
* Click **Actions → Attach volume**
* Choose the **EC2 instance**
* Device name: `/dev/xvdf`
* Click **Attach**

---

## 💽 Step-by-Step: Mount Volume Inside EC2

### 6️⃣ Connect to EC2

```bash
ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
```

---

### 7️⃣ Check Available Disks

```bash
lsblk
```

You will see a new device like:

```
xvdf
```

---

### 8️⃣ Format the Volume

```bash
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
```

---

### 9️⃣ Create Mount Directory

```bash
sudo mkdir /data
```

---

### 🔟 Mount the Volume

```bash
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data
```

---

### ✅ Verify Mount

```bash
df -h
```

You should see `/data` mounted successfully.

## 🧠 What I Learned Today

* gp3 volumes offer **baseline 3000 IOPS for free**
* Performance is **independent of storage size**
* Volumes must be in the **same AZ as EC2**
* gp3 is ideal for **web servers & databases**

---

## 🔄 gp3 vs gp2 (Quick Comparison)

| Feature     | gp2        | gp3         |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| IOPS        | Size-based | Independent |
| Cost        | Higher     | Lower       |
| Performance | Variable   | Predictable |
| Recommended | ❌          | ✅           |

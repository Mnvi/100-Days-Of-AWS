## 📅 Day X/100 – Allocating an Elastic IP Address in AWS

### 🚀 100 Days of AWS Cloud Journey

Today in my **#100DaysOfAWSCloud** challenge, I explored **Elastic IP (EIP)** and learned how to allocate and associate it with an EC2 instance.

---

## 🔹 What is an Elastic IP?

An **Elastic IP address** is a **static, public IPv4 address** provided by AWS.
Unlike normal public IPs that change when an instance is stopped or restarted, an Elastic IP **remains the same** until you release it.

---

## 🔹 Why Elastic IP is Important?

* ✅ Provides a **fixed public IP** for cloud resources
* ✅ Useful for **production servers**
* ✅ Prevents downtime caused by IP changes
* ✅ Can be remapped to another instance during failure

---

## 🔹 Key Points to Remember

* Elastic IPs are **allocated at the AWS account level**
* An Elastic IP:

  * Can be associated with **only one resource at a time**
  * Is **free when attached** to a running EC2 instance
  * Is **charged when unused or detached**
* Works mainly with **public subnets**

---

## 🔹 Steps to Allocate and Associate an Elastic IP

### 1️⃣ Allocate Elastic IP

1. Open **AWS Management Console**
2. Go to **EC2 → Elastic IPs**
3. Click **Allocate Elastic IP address**
4. Choose **Amazon’s IPv4 pool**
5. Click **Allocate**

---

### 2️⃣ Associate Elastic IP with EC2 Instance

1. Select the allocated Elastic IP
2. Click **Actions → Associate Elastic IP**
3. Choose:

   * Resource type: **Instance**
   * Select your **EC2 instance**
4. Click **Associate**

---

### 3️⃣ Verify Connection

* Copy the Elastic IP
* Paste it into the browser or SSH client
* Your instance is now accessible via a **static public IP**

---

## 🔹 When to Use Elastic IP?

✔ Web servers
✔ Production applications
✔ Bastion hosts
✔ Load balancer fallback scenarios

---

## 🧠 What I Learned Today

* Difference between **Public IP vs Elastic IP**
* Elastic IPs belong to **AWS account, not instance**
* Cost implications of unused Elastic IPs
* Best practices for production environments

## Attaching an Elastic IP to an EC2 Instance (Step-by-Step)

---

## 📌 What is an Elastic IP (EIP)?

An **Elastic IP (EIP)** is a **static, public IPv4 address** provided by AWS.
Unlike the default public IP of an EC2 instance, an Elastic IP **does not change** even if the instance is stopped and started again.

---

## 🤔 Why Do We Need an Elastic IP?

* Default public IP **changes on stop/start**
* Elastic IP provides a **fixed public IP**
* Useful for:

  * Production servers
  * Web applications
  * APIs
  * SSH access
  * DNS mapping

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
User → Internet → Elastic IP → ENI → EC2 Instance
```

> ⚠️ Elastic IP is actually attached to the **Elastic Network Interface (ENI)** of an EC2 instance.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

* An **AWS account**
* A **running EC2 instance**
* Instance is in a **public subnet**
* Internet Gateway attached to the VPC
* Route table with `0.0.0.0/0 → IGW`

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step: Attach Elastic IP to EC2 Instance

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Open EC2 Dashboard

1. Login to **AWS Management Console**
2. Go to **EC2**
3. In the left sidebar, scroll to **Network & Security**
4. Click **Elastic IPs**

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Allocate a New Elastic IP

1. Click **Allocate Elastic IP address**
2. Select:

   * Network Border Group → Default
3. Click **Allocate**

✅ A new Elastic IP is now reserved for your AWS account.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Associate Elastic IP with EC2 Instance

1. Select the **Elastic IP**
2. Click **Actions → Associate Elastic IP address**
3. Choose:

   * Resource type → **Instance**
   * Instance → Select your EC2 instance
   * Private IP → Auto-selected
4. Click **Associate**

🎉 Elastic IP is now attached to your EC2 instance.

---

## 🔍 Step 4: Verify the Elastic IP

1. Go to **EC2 → Instances**
2. Select your instance
3. Check **Public IPv4 address**

You should see the **Elastic IP** instead of a random public IP.

---

## 🧪 Test Connectivity

Try accessing your instance:

```bash
ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@<Elastic-IP>
```

Or open in browser:

```
http://<Elastic-IP>
```

## 🧠 Important Notes (Very Important for Interviews)

### 🔸 Elastic IP Charges

* **Free** when attached to a running instance
* **Charged** when:

  * EIP is not attached
  * Attached to a stopped instance

---

### 🔸 Elastic IP vs Public IP

| Feature               | Public IP | Elastic IP |
| --------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Static                | ❌ No      | ✅ Yes      |
| Changes on stop/start | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No       |
| Production use        | ❌ No      | ✅ Yes      |

---

## 🔐 Elastic IP & Security Groups

* Security Groups must allow:

  * SSH (22)
  * HTTP (80)
  * HTTPS (443) (if needed)
* Elastic IP does **not bypass security rules**

---

## 🧩 Real-World Use Case

* Hosting a website
* API backend
* Bastion host
* Database access server
* Load balancer fallback IP

---

## 🧠 Interview One-Liner

> **Elastic IP is a static public IPv4 address in AWS that can be attached to an EC2 instance’s network interface to ensure persistent public connectivity.**

---

## 📘 What I Learned Today

* Elastic IP provides static public access
* It is attached to an ENI, not directly to EC2
* Useful for production workloads
* AWS charges for unused Elastic IPs
